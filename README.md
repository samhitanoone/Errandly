In this app, users can log-in through gmail, facebook, or e-mail. They can then post a task that they need complete or scan a map through a list of available tasks looking for Errand-doers. They can sign up to complete a task. They can also check all their accepted tasks on a separate page.

Do you come home from work and do the dishes, mow the lawn, walk the dog, look at all the things you need to fix, and sigh? Sign up for Errandly. Find people in your area who'll do those things for you. Post a task, wait, and soon, you'll have so much free time, you won't know what to do!
